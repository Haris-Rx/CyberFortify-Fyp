# Malware Simulation â€“ Reverse Shell (Python)

This simulation showcases a basic **reverse shell** script written in Python. The goal is to simulate how an attacker could remotely gain shell access to a target machine. This was executed in a **controlled red team environment** inside EVE-NG.

---

## Objective
- Trigger a reverse connection from the compromised victim (Linux host) to the attacker's IP
- Bypass basic network controls to establish a persistent shell
- Monitor whether **Wazuh**, **Suricata**, or the **firewall** detects abnormal behavior

---

## Reverse Shell Script

The Python script used for this simulation is available at:
```
CyberFortify-Fyp/simulations/malware/reverse_shell.py
```

---

## Explanation

- `socket`: Creates a TCP socket
- `subprocess.getoutput()`: Executes shell commands received from the attacker
- The script connects back to the attacker's machine (`192.168.149.172:4444`)
- Once connected, the attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim system

---

## Detection & Response

- **Wazuh** logged suspicious reverse shell behavior
- **Suricata** flagged an outbound connection on a high-risk port (4444)
- Firewall logged unexpected session initialization from internal to external host
