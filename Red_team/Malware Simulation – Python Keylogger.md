# Malware Simulation â€“ Python Keylogger

This simulation showcases the execution of a **Python-based keylogger** in a controlled red team environment to demonstrate how user keystrokes can be captured and exfiltrated.

---

## Objective
- Simulate an endpoint compromise through stealthy keylogging
- Capture keyboard activity from a target machine

## Attack Summary

| Aspect            | Detail                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP Custom port 4444 (configurable)         |
| Language          | Python (pynput library)                     |
| Functionality     | Logs all keystrokes and saves to file       |
| Operation         | Runs as a background task                   |

---

## Implementation

1. Python script using `pynput` monitors keystrokes in real time  
2. Data is logged into a hidden file (e.g., `.keylog.txt`)
