# Malware Simulation â€“ Privilege Escalation

This simulation demonstrates a **local privilege escalation (LPE)** technique executed on a vulnerable windows machine in VLAN 40 of architecture which is not supervised by any security measures to facilitate the simulation.

---

## Objective
- To change the permissions of low privileged user to root

## Technique Summary

| Aspect            | Detail                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP Custom port (configurable)              |
| Language          | Python                                      |
| Functionality     | Creates a **root** user                     |
| Operation         | Operated when a machine is compromised      |

## Implementation

- For simulation purposes this code is run on machine which is already compromised
- Uses Windows API to check for admin rights so that script can run with admin privilege
- Execute commands to make a new user with hardcoded credentials and admin permissions
