# Privilege Escalation Simulation â€“ Linux Local Exploit

This simulation demonstrates a **local privilege escalation (LPE)** technique executed on a vulnerable Linux machine in a red team lab setup. The objective was to elevate access from a low-privileged user to root using known misconfigurations or SUID binaries.

---

## Objective
- Identify misconfigured binaries or file permissions
- Exploit the vulnerability to gain **root shell access**
- Observe and document any detection logs by **Wazuh**, **Suricata**, or other EDR/IDS components

---

## Exploitation Process

The privilege escalation was performed using a discovered SUID binary (`/usr/bin/find`) misconfigured to allow unintended execution paths.

Example command:
```bash
/usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/bash -p \; -quit
```
This provided a root shell because the binary was marked with the SUID bit and inherited elevated privileges.

---

## Explanation

- SUID binaries run with the permissions of the file owner (often root)
- Misused binaries like `find`, `nmap`, or `vim` can be leveraged for privilege escalation
- This method avoided detection initially, but EDR logged suspicious binary execution

---

## Detection & Response

- **Wazuh** recorded unexpected `find` command with elevated privileges
- **Suricata** did not detect the local exploit (as expected)
- SOC flagged post-exploit enumeration attempts as suspicious
