# Malware Simulation â€“ Reverse Shell

This part showcases a basic **reverse shell** script written in Python which the attacker will use to remotely gain access to an endpoint inside company's LAN.

---

## Objective
- Trigger a reverse connection within insider threat and outside attacker
- Bypass basic network controls to establish a persistent shell

## Technique Summary

| Aspect           | Detail                                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol         | Custom port 4444 (configurable)                |
| Payload          | Commands and file data                         |
| Capabilities     | Shell execution                                |

## Implementation

- `socket`: Creates a TCP socket
- `subprocess.getoutput()`: Executes shell commands received from the attacker
- The script connects back to the attacker's machine (`192.168.149.172:4444`)
- Once connected, the attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim system

## Detection

- Firewall logged unexpected session communication on high-risk port (4444)
