# EVE-NG Network Topology Overview

This section explains the actual EVE-NG topology built to emulate the enterprise environment for CyberFortify.

## ðŸ”¹ Virtual Devices Used

- **Fortinet FortiGate** â€“ Placed at the perimeter as first line of defense, DHCP server per VLAN
- **Cisco ISE** â€“ Placed seperately in VLAN 100, enforces RADIUS auth, TACACS+ on NAD and VLAN assignment
- **Wazuh SIEM** â€“ Connected via management VLAN, collects logs, performs EDR through agents
- **Suricata IDS** â€“ Integrated inside Wazuh, logs network traffic via custom ruleset
- **Data Center Server** â€“ Based on CentOS 7 for simulating a crucial server, in seperate VLAN 50
- **Windows Server** â€“ Active Directory server for supporting Cisco ISE domain
- **NTP Router** â€“ Configured as only NTP master for supporting Cisco ISE
- **Core Switch (Cisco IOSv)** â€“ Trunked with other switches, Hosts VLANs
- **ISE module Switch** â€“ Connected to Cisco ISE, TACACS+ enabled security
- **Access Switches (Cisco IOSv and IOL)** â€“ Connected to endpoints of departments, Access switch 1 is RADIUS enforcer
- **Kali Linux** â€“ Launches attacks into internal zones with help of Internal Threat

## ðŸ”¹ VLANs / Departments

| VLAN ID | Purpose            | Devices                             |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 10      | Endpoints          | Windows/Ubuntu Desktops             |
| 20      | Endpoints          | Windows/Ubuntu Desktops             |
| 30      | Endpoints / R&D    | Desktops, Network Devices           |
| 40      | Endpoints          | Windows/Linux Desktops              |
| 50      | DMZ                | CentOS 7 SRV                        |
| 99      | Segmentation (SOC) | Siem/Ids SRV                        |
| 100     | Management (ISE)   | Cisco ISE, Windows SRV, NTP router  |

- VLAN 10 is department 1 which is supervised by Cisco ISE and its supporting components, these endpoints have access to data center/dmz server
- VLAN 20 is department 2 which is monitored by SOC (SIEM and IDS), these endpoints also have access to data center/dmz server
- VLAN 30 is department 3 which is only allowed access to NetSec R&D section in topology which is just to simulate segmentation
- VLAN 40 is department 4 which is only allowed access to internet

## Summary

This EVE-NG emulation is an enterprise-grade, multi-layered security architecture using some licenced (EVAL) and open-source technologies.
