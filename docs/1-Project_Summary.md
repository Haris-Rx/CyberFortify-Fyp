# CyberFortify â€“ Project Summary

CyberFortify is a multi layered security defense lab designed to simulate real-world red team attacks and evaluate blue team defenses using enterprise-grade and open-source tools. The project provides hands-on experience with detection, response, and identity-based access control in a fully segmented and monitored network environment.

---

## Objective

To build and test a complete cybersecurity defense environment that can:

- Demonstrate blue team defense through firewall policies
- Detect and log threats in real-time using SIEM and IDS
- Apply role-based access policies using IAM and AAA
- Demonstrate robust network segmentation
- Simulate red team attacks (e.g. tunneling, DDoS, reverse shells, keyloggers etc)

---

## Technologies Used

- Fortinet Firewall
- Suricata IDS
- Wazuh SIEM
- Cisco ISE (AAA)
- Cisco switches/routers (networking)
- Kali Linux (attack VMs)
- Windows Server (internal endpoints)
- CentOS 7 Server (data center)
- EVE-NG (virtual lab)

---

## Outcomes

- Using firewall as first line of defense
- Real-time alert generation and dashboarding in SIEM
- Role-based network segmentation enforced by IAM
- EDR capabilities using IDS
- Better network design and control
- Application of tunneling, reverse shells, and DoS attacks

## Documentation

- `Blue_team/`: Defense logs, screenshots, and configuration summaries
- `Red_team/`: Attack procedures, terminal screenshots and malware codes
- `docs/`: Visual breakdown and basic overview of the project architecture
